<!-- img src is for an png/jpg/gif, <br> is for a line break, make sure to put this after every line or else it's all crammed in. think of it like puting in enter in a google doc's text. <H[number]> is for headers, with <h1> being the largest, and <h7> being the smallest. Put this AFTER the line break. <hr> is a visual divider.-->
